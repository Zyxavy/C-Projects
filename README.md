# C Programs / Projects

---
This repository is a collection of my early C programs and projects, created when I first started coding in July 2024. Most of the contents are small experiments, unfinished projects, or programs that may or may not work as intended. Some were abandoned due to lost motivation or because I got stuck on a particular problem.

Note: Due to repository restructuring, precompiled .exe files have been removed. You will need to compile the programs yourself.

```text
gcc [file Name] -o {any executable name}
```

For games or projects that requires max performance:
```text
gcc -O3 [file Name] -o {any executable name}
```

To run:
```text
./{executable name}
```

## Updated (Dec-24-2025)

- The directory `C-modern-approach-projects/` holds exercises and projects based on **C Programming: A Modern Approach (2nd Edition) by K. N. King.**

- The directory `SICP-exercises/` is a collection of exercises following the book **Structure and Interpretations of Computer Programs**, though instead of Scheme, I translated them into C.
